# Groom-You
Groom You is a cutting-edge MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack project designed to revolutionize personal grooming services, particularly targeting Tier 2 and 3 cities. The project draws inspiration from the success of platforms like Urban Company and aims to provide seamless and accessible grooming services to a wider audience.

# Project Overview
Groom You focuses on bringing modern grooming services to areas that may have limited access to such amenities. The project is built on a robust and scalable MERN stack, combining the power of MongoDB for data storage, Express.js for server-side development, React for a dynamic user interface, and Node.js for server-side JavaScript execution. On the client side, their are two types of platform visitors i.e Clients who are seeking for the service and the Service Providers are looking to provide various services to the clients in their region. Both type are supposed to fill forms filling up their requirements. Client and Service Providers would be able to check respective needs in their vicinity.

# Key Concepts Used
1. Axios-> HTTP Requests: Groom You utilizes Axios for making asynchronous HTTP requests, enabling seamless communication between the client-side React application and the server.<br/>
2. Redux-> State Management: Redux is employed for efficient state management in the React application, providing a centralized store for managing the application's state and facilitating predictable data flow.<br/>
3. MVC (Model-View-Controller) -> Server Architecture: Groom You follows the MVC architectural pattern on the server side. Models handle data logic, Views manage the presentation layer, and Controllers handle the business logic and communication between Models and Views.<br/>
4. Layering in React -> Component Layering: React components are organized in layers, adhering to best practices in component architecture. This enhances code maintainability and facilitates the separation of concerns.
